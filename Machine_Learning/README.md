## Intellesis and Machine Learning

The ZEN software platform has various built-in image segmentation function. One of those tools is called ZEN Intellesis Trainable Segmentation, which is using machine-learning algorithms to segment images. More information can be found here:

### Key Features

- **Simple User Interface for Labelling and Training**

  - The tool aims for the non-expert by providing an “easy-to-use” interface
  - Not all “parameters” in machine-learning (an expert might expect) can be adjusted. They are hidden “on purpose”

- **Integration into ZEN Measurement Framework**

  - As segmentation is only the required first step for subsequent measurements the integration into the actual measurement tools is key

- **Support for Multi-dimensional Datasets**

  - Intellesis, especially when considering the BioFormats option, can be used to segment any image even from non-Zeiss systems. 3D stacks, Tiles, Multi-Channel, …

### Technical Specfications

- Pixel Classification by proven and established **Random Forrest Classifier**
- Option to **download** pre-trained DNNs for image segmentation
  - currently 3 pre-trained networks are available
  - import of external networks will come soon (see the [ANN Model Specification](https://pypi.org/project/czmodel/))
- Post processing by **Conditional Random Fields** (CRF)
- Option to apply **confidence thresholds**
- IP-Functions for creating masks and **scripting integration** for advanced automation

### Workflows

#### Downloading Networks

Starting from the ZEN Blue 3.1 release the software allows to download pre-trained networks from ZEISS. Such networks are fully integrate into the ZEN Image Analysis framework and can be used the same way as the classical Intellesis models using pixel classification

### Applications

ZEN can basically read any image data format using the BioFormats Import and Intellesis can therefore be used to segment **any multi-dimensional dataset** that can be imported into the software. Shown below are imaged segmented using Intellesis.

### Software

The actual segmentation service is completely written in Python and is using proven and established open-source machine-learning libraries to segment the images.

To be able to handle even large multi-dimensional data sets, the software has a built-in data manager that takes care of splitting nad distributing the workload depending on the available computation resources.

#### APEER Integration

Due to the fact that the SegmentationService is written completely in Python is can be used a module on the APEER platform. The complete SegmenationService is running inside a Linux-based docker container.

## Scripts

### ZEN_Intellesis_Simple_Test.py

This simple script demonstrated the different possibilities to segment an image using a trained model. The result of such a segmentation is a mask image, which has either as many channels as the models has classes, or one channel containing a distinct label for every class.

### Intellesis_Segmentation_Tool.py

The Intellesis Segmentation Tool allows you to automate and simplify the following tasks:

- Select a model to segment images
- Specify the desired output format for the mask image
- Optional Confidence Threshold that can be appied to mask image
- Optional Extraction of a specific single class
- Option to add the mask image to the original image
- Selection of output folder with file extension filter
- Option to segment all image inside a folder or only apply to active image

Beside this tool is is also possible to run a segmentation using the ZEN built-in batch tool, which does not require this script but offers less additional options.

_Intellesis Segmentation Tool Single Channel - Step 2_

---

The Intellesis Segmentation Tool Single Channel allows you to automate and simplify the following tasks:

- It uses the current active image as an input
- Specify the channel to be segmented and the model to be uses in step 1
- Specify the desired class (for the selected model) and other option in step 2
- Apply segmentation to the selected channel
- Optionally add the mask to the original multi-channel image

Beside this tool is is also possible to run a segmentation using the ZEN built-in batch tool, which does not require this script but offers less additional options.
